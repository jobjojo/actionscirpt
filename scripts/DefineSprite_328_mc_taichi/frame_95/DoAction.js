/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_328_mc_taichi`, frame 95's `DoAction` script.
 * This script controls the visibility of `r_txt` and `c_txt` (text fields),
 * likely related to displaying "rv" (rotation visibility) and "cv" (color visibility) states.
 * It directly sets their `_visible` property based on the `rv` and `cv` properties
 * of the current MovieClip (`this`).
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to direct assignments to visibility properties
 * of display objects.
 * Assumes `this` refers to the MovieClip instance, and it has `r_txt` and `c_txt` children,
 * as well as `rv` and `cv` properties.
