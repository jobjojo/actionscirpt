/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_57`, frame 2's `DoAction` script.
 * This script stops the MovieClip's timeline and then makes it invisible.
 * This likely happens at a specific point in a scene transition or animation
 * where a visual element is no longer needed on screen.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `stop()` method
 * and a direct assignment to a visibility property.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `DefineSprite_57` MovieClip instance (the changer).
