/**
 * Represents a character's face display.
 * This is a JavaScript conversion of the original ActionScript class.
 *
 * It assumes the existence of a base class `MovieClip` which would handle
 * display object properties (like x, y, visibility, stop, etc.)
 * similar to a class from a rendering library like PixiJS or Phaser.
 * It also assumes `MovieClip` manages a `_parent` property.
