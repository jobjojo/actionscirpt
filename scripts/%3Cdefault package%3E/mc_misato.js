/**
 * Represents a "misato" character in the game.
 * This class extends `GameCharacter`, which itself extends `GamePauseClip` and `MovieClip`.
 * It's used to register the 'mc_misato' MovieClip symbol with its ActionScript class,
 * enabling it to use the game's character mechanics.
 */
class mc_misato extends GameCharacter {
   constructor() {
      super(); // Call the constructor of the GameCharacter base class.
      // No specific properties or methods are defined in the original ActionScript code
      // for this class, other than its registration.
      // Any unique initialization for this specific character would likely be handled
      // in the Flash timeline for the 'mc_misato' symbol or by the GameCharacter's
      // `setposition` method or similar.
   }
}

// In a JavaScript environment, the `Object.registerClass` equivalent
// would be a way to map the string "mc_misato" to this class constructor
// within a game engine or asset loading system.
// Example (conceptual):
// assetLoader.registerClass("mc_misato", mc_misato);
