/**
 * Represents a "youko block" clip in the game.
 * This class extends `GamePauseClip`, which itself extends `MovieClip`.
 * It's used to register the 'mc_youkoblock' MovieClip symbol with its ActionScript class.
 * This class does not extend `GameCharacter`, suggesting it might be a special type
 * of interactive object or a visual element associated with Youko's abilities.
 */
class mc_youkoblock extends GamePauseClip {
   constructor() {
      super(); // Call the constructor of the GamePauseClip base class.
      // No specific properties or methods are defined in the original ActionScript code
      // for this class, other than its registration.
      // Any unique initialization for this specific clip would likely be handled
      // in the Flash timeline for the 'mc_youkoblock' symbol or in associated DoAction scripts.
   }
}

// In a JavaScript environment, the `Object.registerClass` equivalent
// would be a way to map the string "mc_youkoblock" to this class constructor
// within a game engine or asset loading system.
// Example (conceptual):
// assetLoader.registerClass("mc_youkoblock", mc_youkoblock);
