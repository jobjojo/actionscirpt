/**
 * Represents an "s_back" clip in the game, likely for background elements.
 * This class extends `GamePauseClip`, which itself extends `MovieClip`.
 * It's used to register the 's_back' MovieClip symbol with its ActionScript class.
 * This clip likely manages the movement and visibility of background elements.
 */
class s_back extends GamePauseClip {
   constructor() {
      super(); // Call the constructor of the GamePauseClip base class.
      // No specific properties or methods are defined in the original ActionScript code
      // for this class, other than its registration.
      // Any unique initialization for this specific clip would likely be handled
      // in the Flash timeline for the 's_back' symbol or in associated DoAction scripts.
   }
}

// In a JavaScript environment, the `Object.registerClass` equivalent
// would be a way to map the string "s_back" to this class constructor
// within a game engine or asset loading system.
// Example (conceptual):
// assetLoader.registerClass("s_back", s_back);
