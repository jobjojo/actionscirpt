/**
 * Represents a "c_taichifly" clip, likely a MovieClip in Flash.
 * This class likely doesn't have complex logic itself but serves as a
 * registration point for a visual asset within the game's display hierarchy.
 * In ActionScript, `Object.registerClass` is used to associate a class
 * with a MovieClip symbol in the Flash Library.
 *
 * This JavaScript conversion assumes `GamePauseClip` is its base class.

class c_taichifly extends GamePauseClip {
   constructor() {
      super(); // Call the constructor of the GamePauseClip base class.
      // No specific properties or methods are defined in the original ActionScript code
      // for this class, other than its registration.
      // Any initialization specific to this clip's visual behavior would
      // likely be handled in the Flash timeline's ActionScript for that symbol.
   }
}

// In a JavaScript environment, the equivalent of `Object.registerClass`
// would typically involve mapping a string identifier to the class constructor,
// or simply instantiating the class directly where needed.
// For example, in a game engine, you might have a factory or asset loader:
// assetLoader.registerClass("c_taichifly", c_taichifly);
