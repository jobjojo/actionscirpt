/**
 * ActionScript code for `frame_4`, `DoAction` script (root timeline).
 * This script is a simple navigation action, advancing the root MovieClip
 * to the `prevact()` frame. This implies it's a part of a sequential
 * animation or scene flow, moving backward.
 *
 * This is identical to the scripts in `frame_12/DoAction.txt` and `frame_16/DoAction.txt`.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `prevact()` method
 * on the corresponding display object.
