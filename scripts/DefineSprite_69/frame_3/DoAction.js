/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_69`, frame 3's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just stops the MovieClip's timeline.
 * It likely marks a specific point in an animation sequence for a sound control UI element,
 * where it should halt after a visual effect (e.g., a "change" animation).
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `stop()` method
 * on the corresponding display object.

// How this might be structured in a JavaScript class (conceptual):

class SoundControlUI extends MovieClip { // Assuming MovieClip base class

   // Method that gets called when this frame's action executes
