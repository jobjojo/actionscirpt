/**
 * ActionScript code for a button's `on(release)` event handler.
 * This script stops the animation/playback of several MovieClips
 * (about_mc, aerial_mc, special_mc, chara_mc), deletes their `onEnterFrame`
 * listeners, and then tells the parent MovieClip to play a "hide" animation.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this would typically be a function assigned to a click event listener
 * of a UI element.
 * Assumes `about_mc`, `aerial_mc`, `special_mc`, `chara_mc` are properties of
 * the current object (or its parent), and have `stop()` and `onEnterFrame` properties.
 * Also assumes the parent has a `gotoAndPlay` method.
