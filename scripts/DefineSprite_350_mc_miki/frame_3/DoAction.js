/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_350_mc_miki`, frame 3's `DoAction` script.
 * This script is very simple: it just assigns the `charatype` property of the
 * current MovieClip (`this`) to the `cfftype` property of `youko_mc`.
 * This suggests a transfer of character type information, possibly for a
 * "Character Flash" (CFF) effect involving Youko.
 *
 * This is identical to the script in `DefineSprite_343_mc_kiri/frame_3/DoAction.txt`.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct assignment between properties
 * of display objects.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `mc_miki` MovieClip instance, and it has
 * a `charatype` property, and `youko_mc` is a child MovieClip with a `cfftype` property.
