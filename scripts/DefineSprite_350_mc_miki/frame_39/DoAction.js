/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_350_mc_miki`, frame 39's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just decrements the `_y` (Y position) property
 * of the `taichi_mc` (Taichi MovieClip) by 50. This likely contributes to a
 * visual movement or animation step for Taichi during Miki's actions,
 * making it move upwards on the screen.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct modification of a property
 * on a display object.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `mc_miki` MovieClip instance, and it has
 * a `taichi_mc` child.
