/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_350_mc_miki`, frame 60's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that sets the `dy` (Y velocity) property
 * of the `taichi_mc` (Taichi MovieClip) to 0. This likely causes Taichi
 * to stop its vertical movement or a specific animation step for Taichi
 * during Miki's actions.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct modification of a property
 * on a display object.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `mc_miki` MovieClip instance, and it has
 * a `taichi_mc` child.
