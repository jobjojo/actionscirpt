/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_421_mc_touko`, frame 36's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just stops the MovieClip's timeline.
 * It likely marks a specific point in an animation sequence where Touko's
 * MovieClip should halt and wait for further instructions or user interaction.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `stop()` method
 * on the corresponding display object.
