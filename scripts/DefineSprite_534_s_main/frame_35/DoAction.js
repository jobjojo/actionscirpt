/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_534_s_main`, frame 35's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that starts playing background music (BGM) from track 2.
 * This likely happens at a specific point in the main game scene's animation or state,
 * initiating a different background music track.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a method on a `bgm_mc` object.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `s_main` MovieClip instance, and it has a `bgm_mc` child.
