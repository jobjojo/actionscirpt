/**
 * ActionScript code for a button's `on(release)` event handler,
 * likely a "Go to Title" or "Main Menu" button.
 * This script calls `allpausestop()` on its parent (to pause everything)
 * and then triggers a scene change to "gotitle" with a new sound.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this would typically be a function assigned to a click event listener
 * of a UI element.
 * Assumes `_parent` has an `allpausestop()` method and a `changer` property
 * which itself has a `changescene()` method. Also assumes `Sound` can be instantiated.

         // and asset loading system in JavaScript. Here, it's a conceptual placeholder.
