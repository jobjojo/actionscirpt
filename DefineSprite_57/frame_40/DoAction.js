/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_57`, frame 40's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just makes the MovieClip visible.
 * It likely happens at a specific point in a scene transition or animation
 * where a visual element is meant to appear on screen.
 *
 * This is identical to the script in `DefineSprite_57/frame_24/DoAction.txt`.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct assignment to a visibility property.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `DefineSprite_57` MovieClip instance (the changer).
