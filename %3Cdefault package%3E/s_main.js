/**
 * Represents the main scene or MovieClip for the game's interface.
 * This class extends `GamePauseClip`, which itself extends `MovieClip`.
 * It's registered with the symbol 's_main' and likely controls the overall
 * game display, including score, character movement, background effects, etc.
 */
class s_main extends GamePauseClip {
   constructor() {
      super(); // Call the constructor of the GamePauseClip base class.
      // No specific properties or methods are defined in the original ActionScript code
      // for this class, other than its registration.
      // Its behavior is heavily defined by the ActionScript placed directly
      // on its timeline frames (DoAction.txt files) and interactions with
      // the `GameControl` object.
   }
}

// In a JavaScript environment, the `Object.registerClass` equivalent
// would be a way to map the string "s_main" to this class constructor
// within a game engine or asset loading system.
// Example (conceptual):
// assetLoader.registerClass("s_main", s_main);
