/**
 * Represents a "taichi" clip in the game.
 * This class extends `GamePauseClip`, which itself extends `MovieClip`.
 * It's used to register the 'mc_taichi' MovieClip symbol with its ActionScript class.
 * This class does not extend `GameCharacter`, suggesting it might be a central
 * object controlled by `GameControl` (as seen in `GameControl.txt` references)
 * rather than a player-controlled or AI character that moves on its own like
 * other `GameCharacter` instances. It appears to be a "dummy" or reference object
 * for positions, rotations, and color effects.

class mc_taichi extends GamePauseClip {
   constructor() {
      super(); // Call the constructor of the GamePauseClip base class.
      // No specific properties or methods are defined in the original ActionScript code
      // for this class, other than its registration.
      // Any unique initialization for this specific clip would likely be handled
      // in the Flash timeline for the 'mc_taichi' symbol or in associated DoAction scripts
      // where its properties like '_x', '_y', '_rotation' are directly manipulated.
   }
}

// In a JavaScript environment, the `Object.registerClass` equivalent
// would be a way to map the string "mc_taichi" to this class constructor
// within a game engine or asset loading system.
// Example (conceptual):
// assetLoader.registerClass("mc_taichi", mc_taichi);
