/**
 * Represents a "nanaka" character in the game.
 * This class extends `GamePauseClip`, which itself extends `MovieClip`.
 * It's used to register the 'mc_nanaka' MovieClip symbol with its ActionScript class.
 * This class doesn't seem to extend GameCharacter, which is an interesting deviation
 * from other character classes like `mc_kiri`, `mc_miki`, `mc_misato`, etc.
 * It suggests `nanaka` might be a special type of character or a base for
 * specific aerial/cff related behaviors defined directly within its own `DoAction.txt` files.

class mc_nanaka extends GamePauseClip {
   constructor() {
      super(); // Call the constructor of the GamePauseClip base class.
      // No specific properties or methods are defined in the original ActionScript code
      // for this class, other than its registration.
      // Any unique initialization for this specific character would likely be handled
      // in the Flash timeline for the 'mc_nanaka' symbol or in associated DoAction scripts.
   }
}

// In a JavaScript environment, the `Object.registerClass` equivalent
// would be a way to map the string "mc_nanaka" to this class constructor
// within a game engine or asset loading system.
// Example (conceptual):
// assetLoader.registerClass("mc_nanaka", mc_nanaka);
