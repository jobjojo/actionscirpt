/**
 * Represents a "sakuraba face" display object in the game.
 * This class extends `GameCharaFace`, which itself extends `MovieClip`.
 * It's primarily used for registering a specific character's face
 * symbol from the Flash Library with its corresponding ActionScript class.
 */
class f_sakurabaface extends GameCharaFace {
   constructor() {
      super(); // Call the constructor of the GameCharaFace base class.
      // No specific properties or methods are defined in the original ActionScript code
      // for this class, other than its registration.
      // Any unique initialization for this specific face would likely be handled
      // in the Flash timeline for the 'f_sakurabaface' symbol.
   }
}

// In a JavaScript environment, the `Object.registerClass` equivalent
// would be a way to map the string "f_sakurabaface" to this class constructor
// within a game engine or asset loading system.
// Example (conceptual):
// assetLoader.registerClass("f_sakurabaface", f_sakurabaface);
