/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_313`, frame 2's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just advances the MovieClip's timeline to the next frame.
 * It likely acts as a simple animation step or a way to proceed in a sequence.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `nextFrame()` method
 * on the corresponding display object.
