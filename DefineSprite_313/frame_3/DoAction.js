/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_313`, frame 3's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just stops the MovieClip's timeline.
 * It likely marks the end of an animation or a sound playback sequence.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `stop()` method
 * on the corresponding display object.
