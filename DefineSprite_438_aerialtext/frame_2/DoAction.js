/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_438_aerialtext`, frame 2's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just plays the `targetdagger` MovieClip.
 * `targetdagger` is a dynamically assigned MovieClip (e.g., `dr1_mc`, `dr2_mc`, `dr3_mc`, `db_mc`)
 * in frame 1 of `aerialtext`, used for visual effects during an aerial crash.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `play()` method
 * on a display object.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `aerialtext` MovieClip instance, and it has
 * a `targetdagger` property.
