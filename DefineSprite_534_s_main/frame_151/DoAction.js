/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_534_s_main`, frame 151's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that sets the `cfftype` (Character Flash type)
 * property of the `cff_mc` (CFF MovieClip) to the value of `effectparam`.
 * This likely transfers a parameter for a CFF effect to a dedicated MovieClip
 * that handles displaying or processing that effect.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct assignment to a property.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `s_main` MovieClip instance, and it has
 * a `cff_mc` child and an `effectparam` property (initialized in frame 1).
