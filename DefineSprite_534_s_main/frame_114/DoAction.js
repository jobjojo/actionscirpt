/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_534_s_main`, frame 114's `DoAction` script.
 * This script stops the MovieClip's timeline and then makes the `back_mc` (background MovieClip) invisible.
 * This likely happens at a specific point in the game or scene where the background
 * needs to be hidden, perhaps during a transition or a special effect.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `stop()` method
 * and a direct assignment to a visibility property.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `s_main` MovieClip instance, and it has a `back_mc` child.
