/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_534_s_main`, frame 46's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just makes the `back_mc` (background MovieClip) invisible.
 * This likely happens at a specific point in the game or scene where the background
 * needs to be hidden, perhaps during a transition or a special effect.
 *
 * This is identical to the scripts in `DefineSprite_534_s_main/frame_114/DoAction.txt`
 * and `DefineSprite_534_s_main/frame_140/DoAction.txt`.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct assignment to a visibility property.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `s_main` MovieClip instance, and it has a `back_mc` child.
