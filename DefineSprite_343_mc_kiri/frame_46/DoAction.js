/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_343_mc_kiri`, frame 46's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just increments the `_x` (X position) property
 * of the `taichi_mc` (Taichi MovieClip) by 25. This likely contributes to a
 * visual movement or animation step for Taichi during Kiri's actions.
 *
 * This is identical to the script in `DefineSprite_343_mc_kiri/frame_38/DoAction.txt`
 * and `DefineSprite_343_mc_kiri/frame_42/DoAction.txt`.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct modification of a property
 * on a display object.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `mc_kiri` MovieClip instance, and it has
 * a `taichi_mc` child.
