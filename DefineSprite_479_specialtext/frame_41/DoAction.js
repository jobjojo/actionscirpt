/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_479_specialtext`, frame 41's `DoAction` script.
 * This script stops the MovieClip's timeline and then makes it invisible.
 * It likely marks the end of a special text animation or a state where the
 * text is no longer needed on screen.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to direct calls to a `stop()` method
 * and a direct assignment to a visibility property.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `specialtext` MovieClip instance.
