/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_479_specialtext`, frame 61's `DoAction` script.
 * This script stops the MovieClip's timeline, makes it invisible, and sets
 * the `specialstatus` property to 1. This likely indicates the successful
 * completion of a special text interaction or a transition to an "OK" state.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to direct calls to a `stop()` method,
 * a direct assignment to a visibility property, and a direct assignment to a state property.
 * It assumes `this` refers to the `specialtext` MovieClip instance.
