/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_315`, frame 2's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just advances the MovieClip's timeline to the next frame.
 * It likely acts as a simple animation step or a way to proceed in a sequence for sound effects.
 *
 * This is identical to the script found in `DefineSprite_313/frame_2/DoAction.txt`,
 * suggesting a reusable pattern for simple animation steps in sound effect MovieClips.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `nextFrame()` method
 * on the corresponding display object.
