/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_315`, frame 3's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just stops the MovieClip's timeline.
 * It likely marks the end of an animation or a sound playback sequence.
 *
 * This is identical to the script found in `DefineSprite_313/frame_3/DoAction.txt`,
 * suggesting a reusable pattern for simple animation stops in sound effect MovieClips.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `stop()` method
 * on the corresponding display object.

   // Method that gets called when this frame's action executes
