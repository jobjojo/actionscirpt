/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_328_mc_taichi`, frame 79's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just stops the MovieClip's timeline
 * and sets the `autoSize` property of a `count_txt` (text field) to "right".
 * This likely prepares a text display for right-aligned numerical output.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `stop()` method
 * and setting a text field's alignment property.
 * Assumes `this` refers to the MovieClip instance, and it has a `count_txt` child.
