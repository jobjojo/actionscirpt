/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_328_mc_taichi`, frame 35's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just increments the `py` (player Y position)
 * property of the `control` object. This likely represents a change in vertical
 * position or a force being applied to the player's y-coordinate.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct modification of a property
 * on a `control` object.
 * Assumes `control` is a global or accessible instance of `GameControl`.
