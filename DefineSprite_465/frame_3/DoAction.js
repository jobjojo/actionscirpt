/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_465`, frame 3's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just stops the MovieClip's timeline.
 * It likely marks a specific point in an animation sequence where the menu
 * or a part of it should halt and wait for further instructions or user interaction.
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `stop()` method
 * on the corresponding display object.

// How this might be structured in a JavaScript class (conceptual):
/*
// Assuming this code is executed within the context of the GameMenu's timeline or state.
class GameMenu extends MovieClip { // Assuming MovieClip base class
   // ... constructor and other methods ...

   // Method that gets called when this frame's action executes
