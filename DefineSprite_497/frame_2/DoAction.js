/**
 * ActionScript code for `DefineSprite_497`, frame 2's `DoAction` script.
 * This is a very simple script that just stops the MovieClip's timeline.
 * It likely marks a specific point in an animation sequence for a score display,
 * where it should halt after a visual effect (e.g., a "breakscore" animation).
 *
 * In JavaScript, this translates to a direct call to a `stop()` method
 * on the corresponding display object.

   // Method that gets called when this frame's action executes
